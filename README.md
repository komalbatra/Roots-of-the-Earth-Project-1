In keeping with the superheroes theme for some of our team members, we thought it would be fun and challenging to create an application that allows the user to answer the ultimate question:

“If I could be a super hero, which super hero (or super villain) would I be most like?”

We all have super heroes we want to be (batman, superman, wonder woman), but do we really match up to them either physically or psychologically or are we really Pickle Rick (From Rick and Morty)? Would we really embrace responsibility when we have great power?!  And what if we don’t want to be a mainstream superhero, who else is out there?!

Our application will attempt to match the user to super heroes and super villains based upon a user’s personality and/or image.  Consider this application as a super-hero personality test.  The user will answer a series of personality questions and potentially upload an image of themselves.  When the questions are submitted, the user will be provided the top 5 superhero and super villains matches to their personality along with a description of their personality.

We envision this app being used by super-hero and super-villain fans of all ages.  Or even people who want a fun way of taking a personality quiz.

Now, when you’re ever asked the question of which super hero is most like you, you can point them to our app!

3. What is the primary goal of the product?
    - To have fun while learning about your personality.
4. The essential features of the Superhero application:
    - As a user, I want to identify which superhero matches my traits.
    - As a user, I want to determine which superhero characteristics I have in common.
    - As a user, I want to discover my friends/peers personality, by viewing their superhero traits.

4. Form should be removed after input submitted.
5. Results screen should be displayed with superhero picture along with common user and hero traits.
6. User name, superhero match, and traits should be stored in firebase database and displayed for all users.
